1.0.12
======

Bugfix release for tile insertions: RedShift has no constraints therefore allows
the possibility for duplicate tiles to be inserted due to our way of testing for
existence and inserting tiles.

* bugfix: inserts of tiles lock database to prevent concurrency issues in RedShift
* in case of duplicate tiles (condition prior to bugfix above), use a consistent duplicate
